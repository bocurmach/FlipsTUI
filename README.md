This project is work in progress and currently has no features other than the original work of Alcaro and contributors.

This project aims to streamline the workflow of patching IPS and BPS files. So far, the plan is to include:
 - selecting one or multiple patches and zip files with patches from a designated folder (i.e. Downloads)
 - patching a default file or any other file if desired
 - move the patched files to a designated or momentarily picked folder
 - deleting of used patches/zip files with patches or archiving them to a designated folder
 - The patching will not be altered from the original.
 - These functions in a Terminal User Interface (TUI) written in golang as this is the language that I want to learn currently. I also intend to use charmbracelet/bubbletea.

I am fairly new to github. This will be my biggest side project so far. I have yet to figure out, wether this being a fork is appropriate, or if importing is the way to go.

Credit to Alcaro and all contributors, who take care of this beloved tool. Thank you!
